									A guitar teacher's job comes with a non-negligible amount of bookkeeping. 
									As a freelance worker paid by the hour, I had to document precisely every workday for my music school 
									which students I taught and for how long, 
									and list these teaching hours in a table on my invoice every month. 
									I had to take into account that the length of a regular lesson varied between students 
									and that there were irregularities almost every week: 
									For various reasons a scheduled lessons might not have taken place, or only partially, or on a different day. 
									Oftentimes missed lessons were divided into 15-minute segments and added to the following lessons, 
									meaning that I had to log not just the hours but also the minute balance for each student at any point in time.                            
								</p>	
								<p>
									As I had very little passion for this part of my job, I built the <i>Music School Organizer</i> 
									using Python, which not only reduced my workload but also minimized my susceptibility to making errors. 
									I am very pleased with the final product. This was my first medium-sized project, 
									and I learned a lot about UX and software design. Moreover, I created something that brought me real value.                            
								<br/>
									Since the app knows one's regular schedule, at the end of a workday, 
									the user only needs to specify any irregularities, 
									and the app assumes that everything else went according to plan. 
									If there are currently missed lessons for any student that need to be made up, one is reminded of them. 
									At the end of the month, with the push of a button, the app creates one's invoice addressed at 
									the music school and ready to be sent in PDF format. 
									The app can also save notes and metadata for each student and retrieve them upon request. 
									In this sense, it serves a guitar teacher almost like a second brain.

										A link to the app will follow soon! Since I've fed the app with sensitive data, 
										which I obviously can't upload, I need to create a hypothetical dataset first.
